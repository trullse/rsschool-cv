## About me
I am the second year student of Belarusian State Univesity of Informatics and Radioelectronics. Programming is very interesting for me. 
During my first year in the university I studied such programming languages as C++ and C#. Have a good base of Math. I've already had some game-development expierience: I and my teammates have created mobile game.
Right now I fell curious about learning JavaScript and I started rs-school course to make decision in which direction I want to develop in future.
